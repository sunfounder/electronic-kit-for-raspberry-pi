Remote Desktop
==============================

If you are not satisfied with using the command window to control the
Raspberry Pi, you can also use the remote desktop function, which can
help us manage the files in the Raspberry Pi easily. There are two ways
to control the desktop of the Raspberry Pi remotely : **VNC** and
**XRDP.**

**VNC** 
^^^^^^^

You can use the function of remote desktop through VNC.

**Enable VNC Service**
************************

The VNC service has been installed in the system. By default, VNC is
disabled. You need to enable it in config.

**Step 1**

Input the following command:

sudo raspi-config

**Step 2**

On the config interface, select **“Interfacing Options”** by the up,
down, left and right keys on the keyboard.

**Login to VNC**
********************

**Step 1**

You need to install the **VNC Viewer** on personal computer. After the
installation is done, open it.

**Step 2**

Then select “\ **New connection**\ ”.

**XRDP**
^^^^^^^^^^

XRDP provides a graphical login to remote machines using RDP (Microsoft
Remote Desktop Protocol).

**Install XRDP**
********************

**Step 1**

Login to Raspberry Pi by using SSH.

**Step 2**

Input the following instructions to install XRDP.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

      sudo apt-get update

      sudo apt-get install xrdp

**Step 3**

Later, the installation starts.

Enter "**Y**", press key “Enter” to confirm.

**Step 4**

Finished the installation, you should login to your Raspberry Pi by
using Windows remote desktop applications.

**Login to XRDP**
**********************

**Step 1**

If you are a Windows user, you can use the Remote Desktop feature that
comes with Windows. If you are a Mac user, you can download and use
Microsoft Remote Desktop from the APP Store, and there is not much
difference between them. The next example is Windows remote desktop.

**Step 2**

Type in “\ **mstsc**\ ” in Run (WIN+R) to open the Remote Desktop
Connection, and input the IP address of Raspberry Pi, then click on
“Connect”.

**Step 3**

Then the xrdp login page pops out. Please type in your username and
password. After that, please click “OK”. At the first time you log in,
your username is “pi” and the password is “raspberry”.
